Script I wrote at work to group UPS shipment orders by hub numbers and sorts them by which hub has the oldest ship request, while still retaining the grouping.
CSV files used are confidential but the format of the csv is like so

JUNK,  DATE, HUB, NAME, CITY, STATE, JUNK
1232, 2016-05-02, 5716, UPS place, place, ST, 34382

The output file is not ready for use as the python csv module inserts a bunch of garbage brackets and quotations. Need to use
Notepad++ or some other program capable of replacing character sequences with a newline(/n) character
