Script I wrote at work to group UPS shipment orders by hub numbers and sorts them by which hub has the oldest ship request, while still retaining the grouping.
CSV files used are confidential but the format of the csv is like so

JUNK,  DATE, HUB, NAME, CITY, STATE, JUNK
1232, 2016-05-02, 5716, UPS place, place, ST, 34382
